# Number-Theoretic Algorithms
Implements the most interesting number theory algorithms that I've encountered thus far. I love coding and math, so I figured why not combine them? Translating math into algorithms into code is fun, and has certainly deepened my grasp of number theory.

## Covered algorithms
1. [Chinese Remainder Theorem](https://github.com/j-w-l/numberTheoreticAlgorithms/blob/main/ChineseRemainderTheorem.ipynb)
2. [Fermat Factorization](https://github.com/j-w-l/numberTheoreticAlgorithms/blob/main/FermatFactorization.ipynb)
3. [Strong Fermat Factorization](https://github.com/j-w-l/numberTheoreticAlgorithms/blob/main/StrongFermatFactorization.ipynb)
4. [Basic Factorization Principle](https://github.com/j-w-l/numberTheoreticAlgorithms/blob/main/BasicFactorizationPrinciple.ipynb)
5. [is Carmichael?](https://github.com/j-w-l/numberTheoreticAlgorithms/blob/main/CarmichaelDetection.ipynb)
